                    Danielius Sodeika's solo exhibition "Form of Word" presents sculptural objects from recent years,
                    mostly made of wood or, in search of an extension of meanings, in duet with another material. The
                    forms of
                    the works are minimalist - it seems that the author listens to nature, follows it, and intervenes
                    only
                    to accentuate what he has heard or understood.

                    This exhibition is a dialogue between form and word. Daniel is a linguist by nature and is always
                    looking for the meanings of words in his everyday life, so the objects that emerge from them appear
                    naturally, in the course of his work.

                    On December 4th the joint interactive exhibition of sensory architecture "Unchanged & Evolving"
                    by
                    architects and interdisciplinary artists Rasa Chmieliauskaitė (Lithuania) and Tomomi Homma
                    (Japan)
                    which was developed over the two years in both countries will be presented at the Kaunas
                    Artists’
                    House. The curator of the exhibition is art historian Justinas Kalinauskas, PhD (Lithuania).

                    This project is a continuation of the non-visual architecture creative residency and the leading
                    exhibition that was presented in 2022 in the former Kaunas Central Post Office. During the two
                    years
                    of architectural research, the two artists, representing the unique cultures of Lithuania and
                    Japan,
                    explored the phenomena of traditional architecture in both countries, trying to build an
                    intercultural dialogue between them, which overcomes both the language and visual barriers and
                    allows through various senses - touch, smell, and hearing - to recognize universal architectural
                    grammar responding to both cultures.

                    sight, smell, taste, touch, and intuition. Connect with each other and the surrounding environment.

                    In this slow hike, we'll seek a connection with our emotional and natural intelligence. We'll do
                    this in groups and individually, within ourselves. This experiential journey is about each of us,
                    our relationship with the environment, nature, and our own nature.

                    Upcoming performance concentrates on uniformity and monotony, its formation and development.

                    It analyzes and questions the very meaning of a great desire to live the way other lives. The taboo
                    for otherness, in the last century, while Lithuania was occupied, has become the greatest trend of
                    this century.
