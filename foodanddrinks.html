      <h1>How much does it cost to eat in Kaunas?</h1>

      <p>
        First time travelers to Vilnius may wonder about the type of foods they will be eating during their visit.
        Before we spent a week eating our way through Vilnius, we wondered about the food in Lithuania too.

        After our first bites and sips, we knew we were in for a week-long culinary adventure. From traditional food to
        modern cuisine, we tasted it all during a Vilnius food tour and at the best Vilnius restaurants. And guess what?
        We learned about the country’s storied past through our stomachs.

      <h1>Famous dishes of Lithuania</h1>
      <p>Like food in most Eastern European countries, traditional Lithuanian food is hearty, simple fare that warms the
        bones on a cold winter’s day. Typical ingredients include potatoes, rye seeds, beets and wild mushrooms – all
        items that grow throughout the country on farms and in forests.

        We liken traditional food in Lithuania to comfort food for two reasons. First, it reminds us of holiday meals
        when our grandmothers would cook similar foods passed down from their grandmothers. But most of all because
        eating the following Lithuanian classics made us happy.</p>

              <h1>Šaltibarščiai (Cold Beet Soup)</h1>
              <p>
                Leave your impressions at home when you taste Šaltibarščiai for the first time. Despite its vivid pink
                color, this iconic chilled Lithuanian soup is as refreshing as it is bright.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to Borscht in Ukraine, Šaltibarščiai gets its pink color from beets. The soup’s other
                ingredients include cucumber, dill, green onions, hard boiled eggs and kefir (a fermented milk product
                made with kefir grains).
              </p>
              <p>Lithuanians typically top Šaltibarščiai with sour cream and fresh dill and eat the chilled soup with
                potatoes on the side. The combination of a bowl of chilled soup and crispy potatoes is a winner.

              <h1>Cepelinai (Potato Dumplings Filled With Minced Meat)</h1>
              <p>
                Also known as Didžkukuliai, Cepelinai is the first dish all visitors should try when they arrive in
                Lithuania. Not only is it considered to be the country’s national dish, but it’s also a great meal to
                enjoy with a mug or two of Lithuanian beer
              </p>
              <p>
                Cepelinai got its name due to its similarity to the zeppelin airship, both in shape and size. But, when
                it comes down to it, a Cepelinas is basically a meat-filled potato dumpling similar to dumplings served
                in countries like Austria, Belarus, Germany and Poland. Think of it as a knödel that meets a pierogi.

              <h1>Bulviniai Blynai (Potato Pancakes)</h1>
              <p>
                Lithuanians have been eating potatoes for a relatively short time – just a couple centuries – but dishes
                featuring the economical tuber are an integral part of their cuisine. They boil the starchy spuds and
                add them to soups, kugels and dumplings. They also fry them to create crispy Lithuanian potato pancakes
                called Bulviniai Blynai.

              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to Potato Latkes that we ate during our youth and Kartoffelpuffer that we ate at Hamburg
                Christmas markets, Bulviniai Blynai are fried pancakes made with savory ingredients like grated
                potatoes, onions, eggs and flour. Most Lithuanians eat Bulviniai Blynai topped with sour cream or apple
                sauce.

              <h1>Kibinai (Meat-Filled Pastries)</h1>
              <p>
                Reminiscent of meat pies in London and Burek in Zagreb, Kibinai are crescent-shaped pies traditionally
                stuffed with a savory lamb filling. Other filling options include chicken, curd cheese and fruit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally introduced by the Jewish Karaite sect who immigrated to Lithuania from Crimea during the
                Middle Ages, Kibinai have withstood the test of time and changing tastes. Though they’re most popular in
                Trakai, resourceful food travelers can find these filled pastries throughout Lithuania.
