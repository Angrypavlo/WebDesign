            <h2>KAUNAS PUBLIC TRANSPORT</h2>
            <p>
                Buses and trolleybuses. There are two types of tickets: A single use paper ticket and E-ticket (monthly,
                92-day pass, 365-day pass or 1095-day pass). Trolleybuses and buses run from 4.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m.
                Payments for Kaunas city public transport are made with the help of non-contact electronic ticket (CARD)
                system. You may transfer different sums of money from your e-purse onto the CARD and/or pay for certain
                kinds of e-ticket periodically. You may buy the CARD at the newspaper stands or in the places marked by
                the special sign “Kauno Viešasis Transportas” (KVT) (Kaunas Public Transport). You must always have your
                card when getting on the means of transport.
                Kaunas was first mentioned in annals in 1361, when the German Order
                was getting ready for an attack on Kaunas Castle. The history of
                Kaunas as a city, however, started in 1408, when Grand Duke Vytautas
                granted its citizens the privilege of self-government based on
                Magdeburg Law. Thus the community of free and economically-independent
                merchants and craftsmen was legalised, responsible directly to the
                ruler. Vytautas ceded Kaunas the right to own the scales, wax
                processing, and woolen cloth trimming facilities. The scales were used
                for weighing the goods brought to the city or packed on site, the wax
                manufactury checked the quality of wax and prepared it for export by
                moulding it into fixed-size pieces, while the wool trimming workshop
                was meant for finishing fabrics. Those were profitable, monopolistic
                enterprises.
